      <b>Senior Manager, Sales Effectiveness</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>No matter what you are doing, you always seem to have time to help. When we have issues with FX1, you are our go-to resource. You really stepped up and went above and beyond to help Laura and I get the RevGen Spring FY18 materials loaded onto
      FX1.
      <br><br>Even after leaving the building on a Friday afternoon, you were very responsive and your help was critical to the success of getting the job done. Your patience and cool demeanor help to calm those around you. You made our success

      <b>SVP Sales at FedEx Office</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>Benjamin, thank you for jumping in and fixing my Sharepoint issue. As always, you were ready to help, dug in, researched as if it was your own problem, helped figure out solutions, and didn't stop until it was done. Never once have I
      experienced you not be incredibly nice, efficient, thorough and helpful. Thank you so much for doing what you do and for being such an asset to your fellow team members.
      <br><br>
      <b>Sr Manager, CR Smith Museum</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>Is there anything that throw you off? If it is, I have not seen it yet. Appreciate how you handle inquiries about SP and fix the problem. I know it’s your job, but it is your choice to do it with a positive attitude and opportunity to teach
      me something new about the system that helps me to perform better as an LA. Thank you for the attitude you bring to work every day and the care you give to team members.
      <br><br>
      <b>Learning Architect, Learning Experience Team</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>Thank you so much for the assistance you continue to provide Production and the business units requesting materials from the production website. Your response is instant and includes various ideas how the application can be improved. Your
      knowledge and dedication are truly appreciated!
      <br><br>
      <b>Sr Specialist, Training Center Operations</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>I wanted to thank you for all of your hard work turning our idea of a leadership development request form into a reality. I just finished working on my first request with the form and the process was so much easier and more effective than our
      old process (or lack thereof). Throughout the process of creating this form, you listened to all of our needs, helped us think through potential issues and tested everything to ensure it was working the way it should be. I truly appreciate your
      expertise and partnership. Thank you!
      <br><br>
      <b>Leadership Development</b>
    </li><br>
    <li>As I've always said, you crave feedback and you accept it as it's intended, never - and I do mean never - becoming defensive. You are literally the best I've ever known at receiving feedback. Keep it up, Benjamin! You are also one of the most
      intentional learners I've met. What is different is how much you obviously love to learn. I'm so glad you're on this team.
